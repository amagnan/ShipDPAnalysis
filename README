***Things are in progress**
->A macro for
  *run plotSensitivity.C with these files, then takes its output;
  *square the epsilons it then save it with .csv extension
  *save into nico's plot
->getting more rates with more smooth lines
->line interpolation(masses may help)
->superimpose the followings; efficiencies(for ploting vs mass),(i.e eta,pt,p)
->Ofc apply them for also meson and pbrem...

 * To send the job for production and true analysis only for qcd:
python scripts/sub.py

 * To plot the sensitivity
Copy the outputs of the previous step (for meson, pbrem and qcd) in a directory inside data/ and modify the path inside macros/plotSensitivity.C then execute:
root macros/plotSensitivity.C++
