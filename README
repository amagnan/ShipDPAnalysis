# outputs(qcd_Ana_rate1.csv,.....) will be on the data folder, and 1th column mass, 2nd column epsilon, 3rd abs(2.3-Evaluated_Rate)
# the outputs should be ordered lower to higher mass for higher epsilons then higher to lower masses for lower epsilon
# if some of the points are not corelated with the curve; one may change them from qcd1/2,pbrem1/2 or meson1/2 text files; there are 5 epsilon for higher values and 5 for lowers ordered w.r.t 3rd (error) column
# After sort the csv files;

#I got the exclusion plots for Epsilon^1 fromr data/181119
# Also you can find the output files for exclusion plots under Exclusion/ordered and Exclusion/notordered

# However LATEST DATAS ARE ON data/181201/
# _rate1 for all SM products(1th column mass, 2nd column epsilon, 3rd column expected rate)
# _rate2 for leptophilic(1th column mass, 2nd column epsilon, 3rd column expected rate)
# _e,_mu,_tau,_pi,_ka,_mix,_sum; 1st column mass, 2nd column eps, 3rd column BR(mode/all_events), 4rd column Ves_Prob(Ves_weighted/mode), 5rd column Reco_Eff(Final_Select_weighted/Ves_weighted)
# _all; 1st column mass, 2nd column eps, 3rd column # of Events, #of DP events, # of all modes, # of Vessel, # of Selected

# I will also have the exclusion plots for 181201 as well today
# Afterwards I will make the efficiency plot, and combined exclusion plot as well (The plot which put on the ESPP paper is not the final one)


# Also If you want to reanalyse them, copy python/Ana.py onto your $FAIRSHIP/macro. Then change the path of the Ana.py for your lxplus and relabel the data on the paths in scripts/ana.sh.
# After that make the relevant folders in EOS...../data folder, and
cd scripts
condor_submit ana.sub
You will find the results under eos.../ana/"DATA"/dat/, you need to merge them as one dat file, and copy onto data/"DATA"
